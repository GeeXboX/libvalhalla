 * Valhalla
     -> Improve the log system to send the messages in a callback
        instead of the stderr (if the callback is defined).

 * Database
     -> When files are downloaded and the reference on this file is no longer
        available in the DB, the file must be removed (covers, etc, ...).
     -> Add a means to easily select an information provided in a specific
        language.

 * Scanner
     -> Add optional support for inotify.
     -> Implement a system to add filters (to ignore some directories)
        for a path.
