 * Valhalla
     -> Implement a system to support an "on-demand" scan. The goal is
        to retrieve in priority the metadata for a specific file.
     -> Improve the log system to send the messages in a callback
        instead of the stderr (if the callback is defined).

 * Database
     -> Add a new SQLite table to store some informations related to the
        library and to the version of the db file.
     -> Add support for file properties (codec, length, bitrate, etc, ...).
     -> Add a public function to get the data for only one file.

 * Scanner
     -> Implement a system to add filters (to ignore some directories)
        for a path.
     -> Rewrite a bit the scanner in order to support several scanners
        in parallel (for the same valhalla object). It will be useful
        when some paths are not on the same device because it can
        increase a lot the speed.
        It is already possible to do that but it needs to create a
        valhalla object for each path.

  * Parser
     -> Fix file type assignment (audio, video, picture, ...).
     -> Retrieve all sort of metadata and not only some fields.
     -> Retrieve all properties (codec, length, bitrate, etc, ...).


 Ideas
 ~~~~~

 -> Implement a structure to add grabbers in Valhalla. The idea is to
    have 3 steps for a file.

     #1 the file is parsed by FFmpeg and saved in the database.
     #2 the file is sent to the grabbers to retrieve new informations
        exactly like the grabbers of Enna (with the metadata retrieved
        by FFmpeg).
     #3 the files (like images) retrieved by some grabbers are downloaded
        and saved somewhere on the disk.

    A first draft of this new architecture is visible at this link:
     http://www.geexbox.org/~schroeterm/valhalla/new_valhalla.png

    The goal is to move the grabbers of Enna in Valhalla and to fix
    definitively the problem of concurrency. Of course, it must be easy
    to add new grabbers.
