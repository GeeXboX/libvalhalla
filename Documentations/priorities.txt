 Grabber
 ========================================

 Only the grabbers where the metadata are >99% reliable (where the informations
 are read in the file), have the HIGHEST priority.

 Parser
 ========================================

 Metadata found in the file have always the HIGHEST priority. It is the same for
 properties like "filesize". But when a metadata is retrieved with the
 decrapifier, the priority is set to NORMAL ("title", "season" and "episode").

              Decrapifier   |   Priority
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Metadata     NO            |   HIGHEST
              YES           |   NORMAL
