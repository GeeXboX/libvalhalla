libvalhalla (2.0)

  2.0.0: 3 Oct, 2010

    Core:
    * The functions to configure an handle are unified with a variadic
      function named valhalla_config_set().
    * Some improvements (speed) with the communications between the threads.
    * The statistics can be retrieved with the public API.
    * Support for global events (only related to the scanner).
    * Improvements with the internal lists (faster and configurable depth).
    * A group name can be retrieved with the public API.
    * The scanner is disabled when no path is specified.
    * The pause mechanism is faster with a group (parsers and grabbers) of
      threads. It uses an asynchronious call.
    * Faster force-stop by using an asynchronious call with all threads.
    * The timeout with cURL is now explicitly set to 20 seconds.
    * A cURL transfer can be broken on the force-stop.
    * Support for MS Windows and Darwin.

    Scanner:
    * The first scanning can be delayed. Useful when the front-end is still
      loading.

    Metadata:
    * New metadata callback useful to retrieve the metadata with the front-end
      as soon as they are available. Note that the use of this callback is not
      recommended.
    * Support of priorities with the metadata. The default priorities used by
      the parsers and the grabbers can be changed with the public API.
    * Support for language with the metadata. It depends of the configuration
      in the grabbers.
    * The filesize is now part of the metadata (technical group).

    Database:
    * The public functions for selections are reworked. A first function
      prepares the statement and a second is used in order to retrieve the next
      available row.
    * The results with the public functions can be limited to a specific
      filetype and language.
    * The files entries with the flag 'external' are deleted when they are no
      longer reachable.
    * The priority and the language can be changed for a specific metadata.
    * The databases from libvalhalla-1 are upgraded automatically.

    Grabber:
    * Support for concurrent grabbers. It can save about 30% of the time with
      a music and video collection and more than one grabber.
    * No more dependency on libgcrypt. The HMAC-SHA2 signature for Amazon is
      computed by libvalhalla.
    * New lyric grabber (ChartLyrics).
    * A new attribute (used by ChartLyrics) provides the possibility to set a
      minimum time to wait between two grabs.
    * Drop LyricsFly grabber (unusable; no valid API key).
    * The TVDB grabber is able to retrieve the metadata for a specific episode.

    Other:
    * Manpage for libvalhalla-test.
    * Test suite based on libcheck.
    * Many various improvements ...
